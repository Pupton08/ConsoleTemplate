# Section B: Mode (2020)

Write a program that asks the user how many numeric digits they would like to enter
and then gets the user to enter that number of numeric digits.

The program should calculate and display the number of times the most frequently
entered numeric digit was input.

## Example
>If the user says they are going to enter four digits and then enters the
digits 3, 4, 5 and 3, the program should display the value 2 as the most
frequently entered digit was 3 and that digit was entered twice.

If more than one numeric digit had the same frequency and was the most frequently
entered then instead of displaying the frequency, a message saying "`Data was
multimodal`" should be displayed.

A numeric digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9

You may assume that the number that the user enters to state how many numeric
digits there will be and the numeric digits entered by the user are all valid.
